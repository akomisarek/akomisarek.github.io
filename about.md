I decided to start yet another software developer blog to share my experience from my journey to make the Internet better place ;). I hope you will find something on my pages, if something is obvious and you wasted your time - I am sorry, it was not obvious for me at the moment I wrote the post, so it has to be useful for someone else as well. 

During my career I have worked on different technologies and levels of software development - I have broken everything from servers, databases to browsers, caused deadlocks, memory leaks, then fixed and improved them!  

If you would like to discuss something with me (or rant about my ranting!), just drop me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

I am Senior Software Developer currently working for Kainos Software Ltd. - but this is my personal blog and views are my own.
