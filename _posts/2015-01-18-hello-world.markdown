Hello World! Or rather I should said Jekyll - this blog is Jekyll driven. If you don't know it and thinking about writing blog go to [Jekyll Homepage][jekyll]. In my opinion it is great, simple tool to create and host static pages. Hosting is easy on GitHub Pages!  

I plan to write about various software development topics like short notes about interesting technologies, tips & tricks, maybe some quick reviews about books, tutorials or courses. I don't like too much text (we do not have time to read wall of letters!), so my posts will be rather short. If they are too short / not cleared let me know! We will improve it together. 

I hope you will like it and find it useful. Thank you for reading and giving some of your time to me! I appreciate it.
